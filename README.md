# DesignPatterns
In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

# Creational Design Patterns
These design patterns are all about class instantiation. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.
-Singleton Pattern
-Factory Pattern
-Abstract Factory Pattern
-Builder Pattern
-Prototype Pattern

# Structural design patterns
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
-Adapter Pattern
-Bridge Pattern
-Filter Pattern
-Composite Pattern
-Decorator Pattern
-Facade Pattern
-Flyweight Pattern
-Proxy Pattern

# Behavioral Design Patterns
These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.
-Chain of Responsibility Pattern
-Command Pattern
-Interpreter Pattern
-Iterator Pattern
-Mediator Pattern
-Memento Pattern
-Observer Pattern
-Null Object Pattern
-Strategy Pattern
-State Pattern
-Visitor Pattern
